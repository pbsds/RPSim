# RPSim
A simulator for the berserker-class in our homebrewed tabletop RPG

#### Todo:
* Make a bytecode compiler/decompiler
* implement ABI
* Make the simulation prompt the user for possible changes during execution
* More visualized map editing
* Make the messages no clutter the screen as much
* Split rpsim.py into multible files
* Make the clipboard reading unix friendly
